# Creating Node.js RESTful APIs 
# What is REST?

REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer. 
It is web standards architecture and HTTP Protocol. 

RESTful applications use HTTP requests to perform four operations termed as CRUD (C: create, R: read, U: update, and D: delete). Create and/or update is used to post data, get for reading/listing data, and delete to remove data.
